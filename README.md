## Background

This is a fictitious case study to analyze a database of employee records from the 1980s and 1990s at Pewlett Hackard from 6 csv files.

#### Data Analysis

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

    There were 300,024 employee records in the output.  Of the total employees, there were more males (179,973) than females (120,051) employed at Pewlett Hackard.  It appears that both males and females were on average evenly paid.

2. List employees who were hired in 1986.

    There were 36,150 people hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.

    There were 24 managers in total in the following departments: 2 in Marketing, 2 in Finance, 2 in Human Resources, 4 in Production, 2 in Development, 4 in Quality Managment, 2 in Sales, 2 in Research and 4 in Customer Service.  We can assume that 9 of the total 24 managers are actively employed.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

    It appears that some employees worked in more than one department because there were 331,603 records returned but there are only 300,024 employees in total.  The top 3 departments that had the most employees were Development, Production and Sales.

5. List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

    There were a total of 20 employees whose first name is Hercules and whose last name starts with a "B".

    There are a total of 52,245 employees who work in the Sales Dept.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

    There are a total of 137,952 employees who work in both the Sales and Development departments with 52,245 in sales and 85,707 in Development.

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

    There were several employees with the same last name.  The top 3 last names were the following: Baba (226), Coorg (223), and Gelosh (223).
